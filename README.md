# Password Generator

## Description
The "Password Generator" is a solo project I completed in the Scrimba Front-End Developer Program, designed to be a real-world utility tool. The goal was to build a password generator that implements various JavaScript fundamentals to create secure, random passwords based on user-selected criteria.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Crafting functions for generating random characters and assembling passwords.
- Implementing robust user input handling to customize password criteria.
- Employing JavaScript's Math object for randomness.
- Manipulating the DOM to display the generated passwords.

## Setup
Clone the repository, then open the `index.html` file in a browser to generate a new password.
